# Probabilistic-Weather-Forecasting
Building and Evaluating Baseline Probabilistic Climatology Model
Overview:
This repository contains the code and resources for building and evaluating a Baseline Probabilistic Climatology Model for weather forecasting. Weather forecasting is a crucial application of machine learning and data science, and probabilistic models play a vital role in understanding and quantifying uncertainty in weather predictions.

Project Goals:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Model Development: Develop a Baseline Probabilistic Climatology Model using machine learning techniques. This model will provide probabilistic weather forecasts, taking into account uncertainty in weather predictions.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and datasets. Understanding the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic forecasts is essential for practical applications.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation, code, and resources to assist others in understanding and replicating the work.
